# nem_analytics
This project reads historical electricity prices from DISPATCHLOAD and DISPATCHPRICES accessed through nemweb or nemosis to give an understanding of revenue generated by utility scale batteries

## Installation

```
cd src/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The Jupyter Notebook `load_price_analysis_nemosis.ipynb` consists the code to load the data retrieved from nemosis or scraped from nemweb.
Each Battery is represented by its own class to ensure modularity and to accomodate future changes to specific battery if required.
